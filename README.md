This application generates randomly colored bugs that represent users in the TrashGangFriends chat

## Setup
Make a bot
Get the bot's oauth token
Add the oauth token to an ENV variable called `PUBLIC_OAUTH_TOKEN`
Execute `npm run dev` in the root!
Add the URL provided in the terminal to a "Browser" Source in OBS
DONE!

Only select ASCII values are allowed in messages, so you might be missing some stuff!
